# CFAM (aka Cibbi Fails At Mvvm)

CFAM is a simple library that combines [FluentAvalonia](https://github.com/amwx/FluentAvalonia) with [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/)'s version of [ReactiveUI](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/guides/deep-dives/reactiveui) and builds upon them to make iteration on GUI applications faster, or at least _it tries_.
